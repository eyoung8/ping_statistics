# ping_statistics
My internet has been running shoddy lately (very bad ping). So I created this script to record my ping and a trace route and scheduled it to run every 30 minutes.

To make this work add ping_statistics.job.plist to ~/Library/LaunchAgents (if on a mac). If on Windows or Linux another scheduling method will be needed.
